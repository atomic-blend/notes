# 🌟 Atomic Blend

Welcome to **Atomic Blend** – the open-source, end-to-end encrypted everything app that seamlessly integrates your **work, personal life, and productivity** into one secure and unified space. I've fallen for the concept of everything app like ClickUp does but I am struggling with the fact to give all my life to a company without any form of end-to-end encryption.

## 🚀 What is Atomic Blend?
Atomic Blend is your **personal and professional hub**, combining task management, note-taking, collaboration, and encrypted data storage into one simple yet powerful platform.

- 🔒 **Privacy First** – End-to-end encryption ensures your data remains yours.
- 📋 **All-in-One** – Manage tasks, notes, calendar, and team collaboration in one place.
- ⚡ **Open Source** – Built for the community, by the community.
- 🔗 **Seamless Integration** – Sync across all your devices, with APIs for extensibility.
- 🌍 **Work & Life Harmony** – Whether it’s projects, groceries, or ideas, keep everything organized.
